<h1>The Best Movies According to Gashu</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies this year</h2>

<hr />

<h3>John Wick: Chapter 4</h3>
    <p>This sequel is as Wicked as the first. Living up to the what great action should be. But that's that as not everyone lives on in the movie.</p>

<h3>Murder Mystery 2</h3>
    <p>Adam Sandler is always the man. Comedic and action packed.</p>

<h3>Rabbit Hole</h3>
    <p>Being a show and not a movie, this one is a deserved honorable mention. Hadn't binged watched something in a long while.</p>
